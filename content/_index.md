## Updates
2024.08.17 Our website has been redesigned using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as the generator, with inspiration from [TeXify3](https://github.com/michaelneuper/hugo-texify3) and [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).  
2021.10.23 An [online forum](https://github.com/way2ml/forum/discussions) based on Github Discussions is added to the top right corner of website. Feel free to leave us messages.  
2019.01.31 [Way To Machine Learning](https://way2ml.github.io/) is launched in [Chengdu, China](https://goo.gl/maps/Hjto2WtzYHeCBsmQ9).
