Welcome to our site! We are passionate about understanding physics through tools like computer simulations and machine learning. Our comprehensive articles cover topics in machine learning, information theory, physics, and more, reflecting our ongoing research journey. Documenting our work helps us deepen our understanding, and we hope it benifits others as well. We look forward to sharing our work and discussing with you. Cheers!
