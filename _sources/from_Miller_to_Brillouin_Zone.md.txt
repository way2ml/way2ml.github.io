# From Miller indices to Brillouin zone
To understand the way to express the surface and directions in solid state
physics, we need to understand some useful tools to better describe crastals. 

What is the unit to build the house? It might be a brick. What are the components
of a brick? It probably includes silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and 
iron oxide (Fe2O3). How they look like?  They can be look like bellow [1-3].

When simple pattern repeated many times in 3D space, a kind of crystal is formed.
The cell of the pattern is called **unit cell**. We can say the above three cells are 
the unit cells of these crystal structures. But we give another name to the unit cell
of the minimum volume, which is **primitive cell**. We can now say the primitive cell
is the brick of a crystal structures. We can imagine there a many shapes of the brick. 

To make thing easier at the very begining, we look at the 2D case. What are the shapes of 
the ceramic tile? They could look like the follow patterns (also called **lattice**). [4]

you can imagine that in 3D, there will be more type of lattices.
