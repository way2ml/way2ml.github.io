# Blogs
Here you'll find all my blogs, along with the tools I rely on in my daily work and life. It's impossible to cover everything at once, 
so my approach is to document things as I use them and keep refining along the way. If you come across any interesting tools or topics, 
feel free to share them in the comments. I would really appreciate it.

  <p class="blog-card-description">The built-in Camera of iOS devices doesn't support timestamps, and I got a task from my mom to solve this. I researched and found two common solutions: installing third-party camera apps or post-processing photos. Neither is ideal. So I created a shortcut that can take photos and include timestamps automatically without the need for third-party apps or post-processing. The shortcut opens the camera, takes a photo, overlays the current timestamp onto the bottom right corner, and saves it to Photos. Just add this shortcut to your home screen and use it like the built-in Camera app.</p>

  <p class="blog-card-description">When I was a kid, I got a digital watch with Für Elise in its music library. I can still hear that digital sound many years later. Today I share the process to build a music generator from basics using Python. You'll learn about sine waves and how computers store sound using sampling rate and bit depth. Then we explore music notes, frequencies, and the equal temperament system. The guide covers playing melodies like Für Elise, adding fade in/out effects with amplitude envelopes, using a virtual capo to change pitch, and playing chords to accompany songs like Hey Jude.</p>

  <p class="blog-card-description">I built a metronome using Python and wanted to share it with friends. But the software can't run unless Python is installed - not acceptable! I needed an elegant drag-and-drop installation experience on macOS. This guide shows how to turn a Python script into a stand-alone macOS application installer in just two steps: first, use PyInstaller to convert your Python script into an application bundle (.app), then use create-dmg to build a disk image (.dmg) with the familiar macOS installation window. Your friends can install your app without having Python installed.</p>

  <p class="blog-card-description">Slow and steady — the most common words when learning guitar. Keeping a steady rhythm is not easy, so practicing with a metronome is essential. I built a cross-platform metronome application using Python and Tkinter. Features include adjustable tempo in BPM, multiple time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 6/8), tempo markings showing Italian terms like Allegro or Andante, and a tap-to-estimate feature where you can tap along with a song to find its tempo. The guide walks through playing click sounds, building the GUI, and connecting all the components together.</p>
