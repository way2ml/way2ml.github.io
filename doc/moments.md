# Moments
- 2025.11.29 We went to Tallinn and experienced [Tallinn's medieval Restaurant: Olde Hansa](https://www.oldehansa.ee/). I like being tipsy in that under dim candlelight. Torrin taught this new word tipsy today. We enjoyed the street performance by an old man, who can sing songs in any language. I had a haircut, guys can tell the difference. I was happy today. <a href="./_static/moments/20251129_myStar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Photo at mystar]</a> 
- 2025.11.27 I went for floorball with Ruslan Ershov, Clara Isabel Prêcheur Llarena, Laura Fieber, Erik Härkönen, Rafael Nuñez Palacio, Voitto Känkänen, Anna Kobets, and Valtteri Turkki. Clara knows Chinese. Ruslan has worked since high school.
- 2025.11.26 I added the feature of comments to this website. It snowed heavily outside. I wished Gang a happy birthday.
- 2025.11.25 I was searching for a picture of my own for the office profile. Then I found <a href="./_static/moments/music_player.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some songs I sang</a> years ago. I'm glad I have recorded these songs. It's an excellent gift. It reminds me that I do love singing.     
- 2025.11.22 We went to [Oodi Helsinki Central Library](https://oodihelsinki.fi/en/), then headed for the [sompasauna](https://www.sompasauna.fi/). It's raining and snowing; I jumped into the sea four times. It was amazing. Without them, I would never do such things alone. Thanks, guys. 
- 2025.11.20 I played floorball with Voitto Känkänen, Rafael Nuñez Palacio, Laura Fieber, Matthew Herbst, and Anna Kobets.

Theo told us that one of his dreams is to master Japanese, as he enjoys reading manga. We became friends in Duolingo. <a href="./_static/moments/20251113_all.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[This photo was taken at the end of the party.]</a>
Checkin, Nostalgia, ABC Bulb, Theo, MJ, Burnout and Pablo.  We were looking pretty hammered (ABC Bulb taught me this word).  
- 2025 11.11 My neighbour's house was broken into. I learned the kids' names: Summer and Sandy.
