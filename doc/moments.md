# Moments
- 2025.12.13 I went to <a href="./_static/moments/20251213_davis.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Davis]</a>'s home for sauna and dinner. We had [Sauerkraut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut) with sausage for Xmas dinner. After dinner, we wrote a story with <a href="./_static/moments/20251213_type.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[the typewriter]</a> I brought. We had a wonderful, <a href="./_static/moments/20251213_story.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[mysterious story]</a>. Then we went to the nightclub. This was my first time going to a nightclub. It's like a group of people meditating in the loud music. So many things happened today.
- 2025.12.11 I went to the Xmas party with Nan, Farzin, and Arzin. I spent a good night. <a href="./_static/moments/20251211_xmas.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Getting tipsy]</a> 
- 2025.12.09 I participated in the Aalto event "Doctoral Career Conversations: Finding Your Next Step" hosted by Susanna Saarinen. She introduced [ek.fi](https://ek.fi/en/) to us.  Laura gave me a very good suggestion about needle testing, which I can try while working in the industry during my PhD. Another colleague recommended [EIT Doctoral Training Networking](https://www.eiturbanmobility.eu/what-we-offer/education-and-training/doctoral-training-programme/) to me. Enate was wondering whether to pursue a PhD in her field. "Good luck, Jie." She told me at the very last minute.  Thank you all. Then I met Xuliang Luo from [CSM](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-applied-physics/complex-systems-and-materials-csm) group. 
- 2025.12.07 Invited by <a href="./_static/moments/20251207_HaoxuanYou.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Haoxuan]</a>, I went to his appartment having <a href="./_static/moments/20251207_HaoxuanYou_and_XiLin.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[great lunch]</a>. I knew some friends: Xiaodan Hong, a warm and outgoing girl who loves cooking and JJ Lin; Ziyi Fang, a new PhD. He made braised pork belly with skin; Yuhuang Fang, a PhD. He looks like Yoga Lin; Zhen Lin, who just got his PhD and plans to go back to China; and another host, Xi Lin. The garlic shrimp and salmon soup he made were insanely good. Thanks, guys. This was a wonderful Sunday. <a href="./_static/moments/20251207_all.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Photo before lunch]</a>
- 2025.12.06 With the help of AI, I can build anything I need. I published [sphinx-molview](https://github.com/HuangJiaLian/sphinx-molview), a Sphinx extension for interactive 3D molecular visualisation using 3Dmol.js.  You can find an example [here](https://way2ml.github.io/blogs/sphinx.html#molecular-visualisation). I also published [twoCC](https://github.com/HuangJiaLian/twoCC), a Chrome extension that displays two subtitle tracks simultaneously on MasterClass videos. Perfect for language learners who want to see both English and their native language side by side! I became much powerful. 
- 2025.12.05 I upgraded [up2git](https://github.com/HuangJiaLian/Up2Git), including the icon, and `deb` package. 
- 2025.11.29 We went to Tallinn and experienced [Tallinn's medieval Restaurant: Olde Hansa](https://www.oldehansa.ee/). I like being tipsy in that under dim candlelight. Torrin taught this new word tipsy today. We enjoyed the street performance by an old man, who can sing songs in any language. I had a haircut, guys can tell the difference. I was happy today. <a href="./_static/moments/20251129_myStar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Photo at mystar]</a> 
- 2025.11.27 I went for floorball with Ruslan Ershov, Clara Isabel Prêcheur Llarena, Laura Fieber, Erik Härkönen, Rafael Nuñez Palacio, Voitto Känkänen, Anna Kobets, and Valtteri Turkki. Clara knows Chinese. Ruslan has worked since high school.
- 2025.11.26 I added the feature of comments to this website. It snowed heavily outside. I wished Gang a happy birthday.
- 2025.11.25 I was searching for a picture of my own for the office profile. Then I found <a href="./_static/moments/music_player.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some songs I sang</a> years ago. I'm glad I have recorded these songs. It's an excellent gift. It reminds me that I do love singing.     
- 2025.11.22 We went to [Oodi Helsinki Central Library](https://oodihelsinki.fi/en/), then headed for the [sompasauna](https://www.sompasauna.fi/). It's raining and snowing; I jumped into the sea four times. It was amazing. Without them, I would never do such things alone. Thanks, guys. 
- 2025.11.20 I played floorball with Voitto Känkänen, Rafael Nuñez Palacio, Laura Fieber, Matthew Herbst, and Anna Kobets.

Theo told us that one of his dreams is to master Japanese, as he enjoys reading manga. We became friends on Duolingo. <a href="./_static/moments/20251113_all.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[This photo was taken at the end of the party.]</a>
Checkin, Nostalgia, ABC Bulb, Theo, MJ, Burnout and Pablo.  We were looking pretty hammered (ABC Bulb taught me this word).  
- 2025 11.11 My neighbour's house was broken into. I learned the kids' names: Summer and Sandy. 
- 2025.11.10 Theo Nguyen learns how to spin a square cushion. I learned a new word [camel pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydration_pack) from him. Pablo learned the Chinese 4th tone by pretending to be shot.
