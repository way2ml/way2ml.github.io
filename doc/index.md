# Welcome
Hei, welcome to my homepage! My name is <a href="_static/docs/jiehuang.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jie Huang</a>. 
Now I am a doctoral researcher at [department of applied physics](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-applied-physics/surfaces-and-interfaces-at-the-nanoscale-sin), 
Aalto University. I use computational methods to study nature; 
I enjoy working with computers. I use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) by the way😃. 
My favorate singers include Michael Jackson, Taylor Swift, S.H.E., and G.E.M. 
Since the website update, older posts written in Chinese are temporarily missing. My past comprehensive posts cover 
topics in machine learning, information theory, physics, and more, reflecting my ongoing research journey. 
Documenting my work helps me deepen my understanding. Now, I want to find the freedom in writing. I'll pay 
less attention to the accuracy since ideas in my head are more important than the language. 
Writing inspires thinking, thinking raises questions, and questions lead to answers.
