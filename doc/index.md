Welcome to my homepage! My name is [Jie Huang](cv), and now I am a doctoral researcher at Aalto University. I use computational methods to understand the physical world; I enjoy working with computers. My favorite operating system is Linux; I use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) every day. I favorate singers include Michael Jackson, Taylor Swift, G.E.M. Since the website update, older posts written in Chinese are temporarily missing. My past comprehensive posts cover topics in machine learning, information theory, physics, and more, reflecting my ongoing research journey. Documenting my work helps me deepen my understanding. Now, I want to find the freedom in writing. I will pay less attention to be accurate. I know my idea in my head is more important than the language. I'll keep writing.
