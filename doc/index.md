# Welcome
Hi, welcome to my homepage! My name is <a href="_static/docs/jiehuang.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jie Huang</a>. 
I am currently a doctoral researcher in the Surfaces and Interfaces at the Nanoscale ([SIN](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-applied-physics/surfaces-and-interfaces-at-the-nanoscale-sin)) 
group at the Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University. I use computational methods to study physics. Since the 
website update, older posts are temporarily missing. My posts cover topics in research tools, machine learning, 
information theory, and physics, reflecting my ongoing research journey and hobbies.
