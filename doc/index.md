# Welcome
Hei, welcome to my homepage! My name is <a href="_static/docs/jiehuang.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jie Huang</a>. Now I am a doctoral researcher at Aalto University. I use computational methods to understand the physical world; I enjoy working with computers. My favorite operating system is Linux; I use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) by the way. My favorate singers include Michael Jackson, Taylor Swift, S.H.E., and G.E.M. Since the website update, older posts written in Chinese are temporarily missing. My past comprehensive posts cover topics in machine learning, information theory, physics, and more, reflecting my ongoing research journey. Documenting my work helps me deepen my understanding. Now, I want to find the freedom in writing. I will pay less attention to the accuracy. I know ideas in my head are more important than the language. I'll keep writing, and I know AI will make it better if needed.
