```{figure} ../data/github_workflow/Github-Workflow-1.png
Fig. 2. Create a branch. Create a branch `my-feature`  when you need to make a change; Make changes in this branch you just created; then commit them; Push the commits to Github.
```

```{figure} ../data/github_workflow/Github-Workflow-3.png
Fig. 3. Make a pull request. Push the commit to the remote; create a pull request from `my-feature` to `main`; on your local machine, switch to the main, and pull from the remote main.
```
